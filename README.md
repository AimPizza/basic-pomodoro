# basic pomodoro

- Study for a specified time, take a break for a different amount of time. That's basically it.
- currently hosted on [my GitHub pages](https://aimpizza.github.io/basic-pomodoro). Try it out :]

## Why yet another pomodoro timer?

- I needed to study html/css/js for an exam and what better practice is there than a project
- there were some frustrations about other timers that made me feel like there should be another version. 
- I'll get to outlining features and aims of this project at one point. I also aim to work on this project until it reaches a nice and usable state. Feel free to open feature requests, issues or even pull requests.
